# TheZoo.cpp

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The Wildlife Zoo is currently using a tracking system to input and store animal data however, the system doesn't have any functionality to maintain or manage that data after it's stored. The objective of this project is to develop a new system that would integrate with their existing one that would allow the animal data to be maintained and managed. 


# What did you do particularly well?
What I though I did particularily well was arrange and structure my code in an logical and organizaed manner that grouped each section by what that block of code was attempting to accomplish. By compartmentalize my Contruct Classes, Add/Remove functions, load, etc. it allowed me to have a foundation from end to end. This not only helped me stay focused and organized, but it also allowed me to append to or modify code in each respective section later on without having to navigate to extesnively or lose my focus on what that section of code was intended to perform. Towards the end of my submission, I added some finishing touches such as string strimming and padding to prevent spacing errors or potential typos on the front-end, but also to dispaly the data in a more structured pattern visually.


# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code by adding more comments and notations that were more developer friendly for the next person to read the code. That being said, I'm uncertain if there was really anything that I could have done to make the code more efficient or secure, at least not my current knowledge or capabilities.


# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found this code challenging because of the large dataset and subsets of data the code must account for, e.g.: each animal type, animal subtype, tracking number, name, number of eggs, nursing, etc. Since there was a large number of datasets, I encountered significantly more syntax errors, debugging issues, and other errors than many projects before. I was able to overcome these errors with patience and slowing down to really proofread my code and querying my debug and compiling errors against supports forms on Eclipse's website, as well as Stack Overflow, Reddit, and W3 School. Perhaps due to my novice experiencing with C++ and programming, these online web forums are really the only resources I've been able to find useful for my scenarios and will continue to add them to my support network.


# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Almost every skill used in this project will be particularly transferrable to other projects and course work because most of what this code accomplishes and contains, I imagine is used in most programs. Construct, Add/Remove, load, delete, view, if/else loops, printing, displaying, padding, vectors, polymorphism, etc. All of these skills or methods used in this code should be transferable or at least relevant to other projects and courses that I may encounter in the future. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by laying the groundwork and foundation of each action I wanted my code to perform. It's maintainable because it can be added to or easily modified. Readable because it's well organized and structured by each action or function being performed. Lastly, it's adaptable because it accomplished polymorphism and leverages multiple coding languages, which can be utilized to introduce future files of code of different languages (so long as their compatible) into its existing state.
